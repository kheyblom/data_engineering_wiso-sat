# STATE.md (gridding/): working state / handoff

Read this first in a new session. Update it whenever work lands.

## Where we are (2026-11-11)

- **TROPOMI 0.25° daily finalized** (2026-11-11; TESTING.md Tier 3): 2,945
  days (2017-11-08 to 2025-11-30), 17 spatial and 17 temporal stores, 134
  GiB each layout, under `/glade/derecho/scratch/kheyblom/data/wisosat/zarr/tropomi/`
  (`spatial/`, `temporal/`, beside `l2/`; moved from `wisosat/grid/tropomi/`
  2026-11-11, user decision, root CLAUDE.md "Store layout");
  tag **`v8.1-verified-20261111`** on all 34. Verify spatial 629 checks,
  temporal 1,513, 0 failures; `--gc` found nothing to collect. Rechunk
  float64 stores ran at the 64 GB memory request (TESTING.md): halve
  `block_rows` or ask for more memory for a longer record or finer grid.
  fixes: the verifier compares thresholds at the stored precision, and
  TROPOMI's cloudy row is optical thickness >= 0.3 (user decision, T24).
- **Pipeline** (2026-11-10): build, verify, finalize, rechunk, submit
  wrapper and the fixture test; layout and decisions in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Design decisions** (user, 2026-11-10; recorded in `CLAUDE.md`,
  "Decisions"): common engine with per-product inputs, TROPOMI first;
  grid type, resolution and frequency (`day`, `<n>day`, `month`,
  `<n>month`) in config; periods counted from 1900-01-01; grid tokens
  `latlon_0p25x0p25` / `ease2_m25km`; `spatial/` + `temporal/`
  directories; 8 statistics + 9 sums per (grid, frequency); temporal =
  rechunk of the tagged spatial store; sampled verification. New
  nomenclature rows (14 variables: 5 statistics, 9 sums; `month`, `3day`) added in style_guides
  `8144058`.
- **TROPOMI method:** as decided 2026-11-09 (`../docs/technical/gridding-method.md`).
  The pipeline reproduces the drafting code on a full production day to
  1e-9 (TESTING.md).
- **The method doc** has its store table (Section 10) and the weight in mol.

## Next

0. **After the 2026-11-11 move:** `finalize_grid_wisosat.py --relocate`
   (new; it rewrites `related_store`, `source_l2_stores` and
   `rechunked_from`, and appends the move to `history`) was dry run on both
   layouts: 17 + 17 stores. `--apply` waits for the user's sign-off. The
   tag `v8.1-verified-20261111` stays on the snapshot before the move, with
   the old paths; whether to add a new tag is the user's call.
1. **TROPOMI first: 0.25° at day** (user decision 2026-11-10); the other
   sensors' decisions come after TROPOMI is built.
2. ~~Bench, production build, verify, finalize, rechunk, temporal finalize~~
   (done 2026-11-11).
3. Further TROPOMI grids or frequencies (EASE M25km, month, n-day) only on
   the user's request: each is a config entry and a build.
4. **Other sensors** need their gridding inputs decided by the user before
   any config (survey 2026-11-10, from the product docs). What each lacks
   against the method's five inputs (time, footprint polygon, column δD,
   noise-only σ, H2O column in mol m-2):
   - **SCIAMACHY:** corners (order unverified) and H2O column, but **no
     δD** is published and no exact σ can be derived (`sciamachy.md` P2,
     S4); WISO-SAT's selection needs per-file statistics.
   - **GOSAT, GOSAT-2:** centres only (~10 km circle, Sarkar et al.);
     column-averaged δD with a 1σ of undocumented kind; only XH2O (1e-6),
     absent on ~56% of δD soundings (G1) and sometimes negative (G8).
   - **AIRS, CrIS (TROPESS):** centres only; δD is an 850-250 hPa level
     mean, not a column (Q2b), so the H2O-weighted mean is not the δD of
     summed columns; its σ is not noise-only and is missing on ~70% of v1
     rows (R17); no H2O column; CrIS SNPP RS and FS overlap 2021-02..05
     (R26), so gridding both double counts.
   - **IASI, TES:** not built in L2 yet.
   Each needs: a footprint model (e.g. a centred circle of a stated
   diameter), the δ, σ and weight variables (or a decision to weight by
   area alone), its selection, and a "Gridding inputs" section in its
   product doc.
- **Environment:** `gridding/pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` (shapely and
  pyproj named for the verifier); see the root CLAUDE.md, "How the halves
  connect".
